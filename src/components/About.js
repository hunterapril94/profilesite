        <p>I have always been a first-rate question asker and a first-rate answer finder. 
          As a child I asked questions like "what's inside rocks?"
          and found the answer by pounding them together until I could see the inside. 
          In college I explored the wonderful world of learning how languages work.
          I dissected them to find their inner workings like they were the rocks from my childhood.
          Then I found web development. A whole new set of languages with a whole new set of rules,
          constantly evolving to be more efficient. I couldn't help but fall in love.
          I'm not just a programmer who can memorize the basics, I will never stop trying to find the inner workings of development.
